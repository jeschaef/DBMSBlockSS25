We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.  Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.

The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.    The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel char",2001-11-08,w..cantrell@enron.com,RE: PGT Fuel Treatment

Gray Davis says he is open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being proposed by lawmakers on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year.   He also broke with his appointees on the Public Utilities Commission in saying private companies and other large users should be allowed to contract directly for power with generators.   . . . .   For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities.   A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts.   \'"That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid,\'" Davis said. \'"But our problem is the opposite this summer.

I‘m not sure if I‘m reading the schedule correctly, but here are some items to think about:  1)\tThe price to Trigen is a 3 month average of NGW and IF for Z3 and Z4 times a premium. 2)\tBecause only one month at a time rolls off the books, there will always be an OA variance. 3)\tThe OA variance due to the 3 month rolling average will eventually flatten out over time. 4)\tThis OA variance, however, doesn‘t address the fact that Andy is getting 50% Z3 and 50% Z4 and having to deliver Z4. 5)\tFor November 2001, there was some gas that was delivered at Z3, but the price was not adjusted for fuel and transport, so if \tyou deliver gas at Station 65, you do not get the same price as you would for Station 85.

<27931069.1075856485447.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Chris,  This is very well written and will serve the reader well. A few comments.  1. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the  classification based on 3 categories:   a. variance/covariance  method                 b. historical simulation                 c. Monte Carlo simulation.  Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument.  2. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio. The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor‘s expansion)  that may  involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the  same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).  The main benefit of using the  MC simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way.

As a courtesy follow-up to that meeting, I wanted to tell you about him and  the skills I think he possesses.  LaRence spent 2000 working for 3 different  bosses in EBS, and when the music stopped with me at the helm, he had not  produced enough identifiable work product for any one of us to be able to  fall on our sword for him.  The double whammy was that he was at the point of  aging out of the Associate program and in need of a commercial position.  In  my opinion, LaRence was not suited to the type of work I need my people to do  in EBS Structuring, and I had to pass on a promotion for him.  His ranking  stems from the fact that he couldn‘t keep up with the other Associates in the  group with respect to hard-core models and business analysis.

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.  Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.

What constitutes a key product is discrestionary. There is no minimum spread we have to provide. If we are hit on any number on the screen then they pass through 0.25p/MWh to us (half of their bro on the other side). This is not an exclusive relationship. This deal is not linked to EOL. Either side can terminate at any time if it‘s not working out.  Effectively all this means is that we have another route to market, which ends up being 0.25p/MWh cheaper.

There is an industry hub meeting next week - with limited attendance.  While continuing to promote the neutrality of the CL hub, Tom would also like to move this industry issue forward by possibly promoting the sale of interests in the CL hub.  I asked whether or not the hub can be separated from the base CL product (e.g., the general infrastructure and individual modules) and Tom responded that it is quite possible to separate the hub (and its support mechanisms - including the data base information) from the CL product.

This information on the FERC process was provided by Ron Johnson who is actively representing PGE in these proceedings.  For the period October  through February  we sold net power to the Cal ISO and PX  for $82 million ($93 million of sales and $11million of purchases),  of this amount approximately $34 million was for power sold under the DOE order to sell.  All sales to the Cal ISO and PX in 2001 were done under the DOE order.  To date we have received payments of $12 million which leaves a current outstanding receivable of $70 million.  Sales under the DOE order are not subject to refund in the current proceeding, however there is a possibility of a separate proceeding in the future on these transactions.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company‘s current circumstances.  After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.

This time is no different. Indeed, many of them thought they caught it at the beginning of April this year. They were wrong.  Picking the exact bottom can be very rewarding, of course.

After these cyclical lows in stock prices, the average 12-month gain was an impressive 28%.  In this special issue of the Global Strategist‘s Handbook, I present numerous charts relating key economic and financial indicators to the cycle in stock prices with the focus on finding the ones that are most useful in picking bottoms.

The  desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side  of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.

This represents the price  difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and  what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us  out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add  an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and  Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another  $4.7 MM.  A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced  from Nigeria or Algeria(???).   Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be  November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date  of this last",2001-05-03,paul.y‘barbo@enron.com,Update - EcoElectrica Winter Cargo

To my knowledge (and I have checked with Peter and he has confirmed), the only prepay deal that has been done by ECC or out of the ECC office was the Alberta Prepay dated September 28, 2000 among ECC, Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, ENA and Chase.  The obligation was retired on September 28, 2001.  I believe Tana has all of the relevant documentation relating to that deal.

Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the  archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed  impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The  report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during  construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor  and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we  fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline  activities will not disrupt the site.

Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.   \tThe CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002.  They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volu",2001-10-12,kit.blair@enron.com,ISO Increase in Grid Management Charges

The topic is  technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th  edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own  time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously  would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the  book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary  information, however.  What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is  willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not  think that would be worthwhile.

Thought it would be a good idea to spend 30  minutes discussing those themes and developing our messages to ensure  consistency.  If folks think it would be useful, is there a time this week  that we could squeeze in 30 minutes?  Thanks.

I am following up your offer the last time we met to call you  when I was next thinking about making a job change.   The last time, when I  moved to DOE from OMB in the White House, we were trying to meet but had just  been unable to match our schedules.  I am from California, and am most interested in going back to help some  business in the energy sector carry out an effective strategic approach to  that market during this difficult period.

TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly  talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members \'"predisposed to  Enron‘s point of view.\'"  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA‘s requests  to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy.

I was under the distinct impression that your version would have the decision variable function but limited to two choices for cells that could operate as decisions.  I would suggest that you try Tools - Crystal Ball Decision and see if your software permits access. If not, you may have to try several decision choices in separate simulations (a little more tedious but this is essentially what Crystal Ball would do). I spoke with the same person at Decisioneering, and she indicated the student version of Crystal Ball should be able to set up the decision cells and function correctly (as long as you go through the Tools - CB Decision steps, not just the simulation (triangular) start icon.

Monitor Enron‘s Bundled and T&D load % behind a utility. One of Enron‘s biggest risk factors in California relates to Enron‘s percentage of the utility/state ESP business.  EES and EEMC together were 80 - 90 % of the total ESP load behind PG&E and SCE.  This is great unless things go bad, i.e. California.

<20866686.1075845896093.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"FYI, there is nothing in the permit that provides an allowable lower limit on  the turbine load factor.  In the permit application, we provided emission  estimates for 50 to 100 percent load and termed this as the \'"expected range  of operating conditions\'".  We can operate below 50 percent load, but would  likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would  operate the plant.  Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 100  percent load factors, I suggest that we adopt 50 percent load (approximately  85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.

In contrast to the Financial GTC‘s which when read with the ETA are  drafted on the basis that the GTC‘s only apply if an ISDA has not been  executed,  the HDD Swap GTC‘s have been drafted to work in unison with the  ISDA framework.  The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation  for each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Form.   I have  made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the  carve out of the language in the ETA which provides that GTC‘s will only  apply if an ISDA has been executed.   Incidentally - with respect to the ETA - it seems to provide that the  relevant GTC‘s will apply in respect of a Transaction if an ISDA is not in  place on the trade date of such transaction, however it does not seem to make  any provision for circumstances where an ISDA/Master Agreement is entered  into subsequent to the execution of a Tra",2000-09-06,denis.o‘connell@enron.com,Weather Derivative GTC‘s

Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.

There are only two wells to worry about getting calls from.    1)  West Cam 310/313 (Hios) you may here from Elma with Forest regarding a change.  She called today with a change for the 7th to go from 3795 to 3700.  I‘m going to go ahead and let Steve Lewis at Petrocom know, so you shouldn‘t have to worry about it unless she calls back.  I did however, give your number to her.  Her number is 337-265-2622.  2)  EI 57 (Trco) you may hear from Janine with Samedan.  She just just her volume for today‘s flow, so I doubt that you‘ll get any new changes.  The current flow is at 1400.  Janine‘s number is 580-221-1200.    If you get a call regarding either well, just call Steve Lewis with Petrcom and let him know.  His number is 713-353-2752.  He‘s very nice and easy to work with.

Sorry about that.   I had not heard anything about a suprise party for Rich in Houston but regardless, with Red Rock, annual outages etc...  it would probably be a difficult time for me.  If I can help with anything please give me a yell.  The next trip to Houston, will probably tie in with a family vacation to Tx. sometime in July.    We are making arrangements to give Rich a retirement party in the field as well.  I was responsible for donations as you know (got to keep it quiet now but we are getting him a four wheeler).  Rick and Arnie are setting up the party which will probably be on April 13 and most likely in Belen, Nm.    Again, the check will be cashed this week. and thanks to all of you....

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy‘s slide #20, \the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great\'" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G‘s nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.   However, we do support intra-day capacity release.   -----Original Message----- From: \tVickers, Frank W.

Factor loadings are an input to Value-at-Risk (VAR).  Generally, you can  consider them the determinants of relationships between curves,and points on  curves based on trader inputs.   These pertain to all curves not just North  American Natural Gas.  There is a specific program which calculates these  relationships which requires a considerable amount of processing time (3  hours per run) as well as another few man-days to evaluate the results.    There is no \'"ideal\'" or recommended period in which these must be updated.   More frequent is \'"better\'".  Given the amount of time it takes to refresh, it  was \'"agreed\'" a long time ago amongst  RAC, Research, IT and Operations that  it would be done every 2 weeks.  No commercial input was received.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.   We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.

If they have enough volume, then it will attract even more bidders because the bidders do not have to think too much about the \fair\'" price because they will always get the lowest successful price anyway. If there is small volume, then it will become harder for the bidders to decide on optimal bidding strategy.

Many believe  that a number of the energy services we have identified are already included  in the General Agreement on Tariff Services (GATS) and merely need to be  tweaked for defination purposes. There is also recognition that a number of  energy services are thought to be included under the existing financial  services provisions.  We believe this is good news because it reduces the  amount of bargaining that pro-energy services negotiators may find necessary.

Non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by Enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part, non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual.

Speaking of which, Capt. Yorek, who heads Central Division, of which we are a tiny part, and I were at a luncheon together yesterday.  He was there to talk about the month-long anti-vice sweep they ran.  They were particularly trying to break up teenage prostitution and dope dealing in the Neartown neighborhoods.  They made 100 arrests.  They are now doing follow-up sweeps.  He also said that they are trying to cut down the rampant auto burglaries going on in our area.  Emphasized to park under lights where possible and to not leave anything in sight in your car.  We had a car break-in at my house only this week.

Now, it seems that that    price has gone up to $9 or more per MWh, once all ancillary charges have been applied.       Cara and I are working on a comprehensive excel document that will show you all of the charges that could be assessed when you purchase and wheel transmission. We hope to have this updated soon.    Until then, I have been handing out summaries as I receive information.  I will continue to put information in your boxes or give it to you in our weekly meetings.

Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.

As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement  involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and  Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding  that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland  shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the  lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical  to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as  a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent  liability.  Lets discuss.

Enron needs to shed some of the risk of this deal in order to be able to do  more of them.  I think the insurance market is a great platform to accomplish  this.  I think our success potential is high as long as Enron is in a first  loss position and pro-rata loss for the balance.  However, I am not confident  that the insurance industry will be able to work up a meaningful offer.  My  solution is to calculate a bid for their services.  The loss I am trying to protect is associated with a bankruptcy process where  Enron seeks to gain control of the underlying asset and/or its liquidation.   I propose that the trigger for an insurance pay-out would be the sale of the  underlying project to a third party in a liquidation scenario for the benefit  of creditors (i.e. EPMI).

We download power plant outage data from the California  ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated  scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table  with key fields:  Date and Res Name.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.  Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.

I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for  pain and  discomfort when, most  times, there is so combination of medicines  that will get the job done.

We are happy, though, that Cliff‘s primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.  Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.  Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron‘s wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron‘s wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.  We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.  Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.",2001-05-01,ken.skilling@enron.com,Cliff Baxter

While Scott was here, we arranged for him to be included in the Oct 29th Trading Track interviews.  This seems to be the best thing for him given that he really wants to become a trader.  Once in the program, he‘ll have 4 rotations (6 months each), some of these would likely be on the west desk.  Mike and I have talked and both agree that it makes good sense for Scott to join west gas given his experience in Portland.  However, the only hitch is that Mike cannot unilaterally decide to bring Scott to the desk.  He will need to negotiate this with the other desk heads and the program director.

They have completed 1 well and will drill up to 4 more development wells, in the near future.  The location he verified is Sec. 31, T19S, R21E, Eddy County, New Mexico.  He called us wanting an I/C, because the old map he was using indicated that Enron owned the lines.  The problem is that these were the gathering lines that we sold to Agave 5-6 years ago.  We still own the Atoka #1, 2 & 3 gathering compression units and the main branch lines,  but these wells will have to be connected to the Agaves Gathering system.

Given the initial ground work done by   our team at ATT leadership level, the meeting between Jeff and David Dorman,   we think did go as expected by us. I am sure Dave and Stewart, along with   Jeff have shared their views of the meeting, and do feel positive about  the   process forward.  Our take on the meeting is as follows:  1. Dave Dorman is open and eager to explore ways ATT and Enron could   cooperate across the board.  2. Dave wants to move fast, but at a pace that will work within ATT, and is   strategically sound for both the organizations  3. He is now looking forward to specific value propositions from   Enron-Adventis team, which he is prepared to discuss with us.  4.

Last Friday, this  caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about  $50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day.   This transmission capacity is within the ISO‘s control and, because capacity  is available, the ISO‘s actions seem to violate Order No. 888.

Then I took him some stuff that was at my house yesterday and we hung out a little bit.  I‘m still hoping there‘s a chance we can get back together, but I don‘t want to get my hopes up too much.  He definitely needs some time to himself and to get over this bout of depression.  I just hope that if he does, then he wants to get back together then, but I‘m not sure he does.

I havent spread this around yet,  except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into  groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor  station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the  night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other  housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine  back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they  would address the issues identified.

The EISB  new By-Laws will be publicly available in a couple/few weeks.  It will be able to accomodate ANY type of organization for each of it quadrants.  If the Wholesale Electric Quadrant (WEQ) wants to include both reliability and commercial standards, it may.  If the WEQ wants only to address commerical it may...and every permutation of the two.  So, EISB is flexible enough.  One possibility that has been proposed (and I believe it comes from the NERC staff) is that NERC could be \reliability only\'" and operate with a Memorandum of Understanding with the EISB WEQ that would be focused on commercial issues.

Rich said that it will be a notice of inquiry, not a proposed rulemaking.  The NOI will essentially ask three questions: (1) should DOE issue a proposed rule? (2) Does DOE have the legal authority to do so?  (3)  if DOE should issue a rule and has the authority to do so, what should be included in the rule?  The NOI will not contain any proposed language.  The comment period will be 45 days, and Rich does not expect this Adminstration to act on this issue.  In effect, he said, they are simply teeing the issue up for the next Administration. (This assumes that the pending reliability legislation is not passed during the upcoming lame duck session, which I think is a pretty safe assumption.)

This  should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation  contract.   The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for  redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes  at the receipt point into Destin.  If you bill us on gross volumes, then you  must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in  transportation costs from the pipeline.

<17242313.1075842506938.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"This morning I raised a concern regarding TW‘s sale of excess fuel at  downstream points.  Here‘s the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to  tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those  receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines  unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that  make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That  latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point \'"x\'", it should  resell the gas at point \'"x\'" and not haul the gas to point \'"y\'" and then sell  it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was  that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that  gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement  (because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the  transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the \'"furthest  upstre",2000-11-27,drew.fossum@enron.com,TW Fuel

We are not doing a profit split this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA‘s capacity is 21MW, but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA.   The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour.   IN CAPS: We sell to NCPA in ZP26.   We buy from NCPA in NP15.  We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).

Two years later, I was talking to Microsoft executives in Redmond, who were looking for a partner to conquer a high-tec broadband world. I don‘t know any other company, which can offer such an opportunity for a change and growth, and which is able to change itself so much as Enron.

Instead of reaching 30 Tcf by   2010, the nation will likely be consuming about 29.58 Tcf per year,   and will reach 31.33 Tcf per year by 2015. Demand is forecast to   increase in all sectors but most dramatically in power generation,   which will likely see a 106% increase by 2015. Demand growth is   driven by increased power generation demand, but a large amount of   demand will continue to be for winter peaking needs. January   consumption will increase from 86 Bcf per day in 2000 to 113 Bcf per   day in 2015, or about 2 Bcf per year.

<8552457.1075863309389.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Mike McDonald and I met with WAPA and the Bureau of Reclamation on Tuesday (7/17) and learned some interesting information about their relationship with PG&E.  On Oct 28th PG&E filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with WAPA.  Currently PG&E looks at the imbalance energy (positive or negative) at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party.  The imbalance account is calculated by aggregating MWHrs for the entire month.  As a result, WAPA would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out.  As of OCt 28th all this changes - WAPA has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to PG&E imbalance prices (which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices).  I believe this means that WAPA is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets.  We probably need to gear up our relationshi",2001-07-20,stewart.rosman@enron.com,WAPA‘s Increased Acitivities

Mitsubishi‘s strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining  loadport sample to come up off-spec on retesting, for obvious reasons.     Prior to the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will be aware that (a) D3605 without  ashing is in the FGH contract and that (b) ECT believes D3605 without ashing  may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product.

I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have  several people who have not left before 10:30 this week.  2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on  Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading  floor until after 5:00 p.m. 3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and  benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here  late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One  suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my  understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

The second swap of $350mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from El Paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly. This hedge does appear to have been set with the El Paso payment stream in mind. The original $32mm of swaps DID NOT provide a clean hedge to the remaining El Paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the El Paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer. However, the $382mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged.  It appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time, a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the \'"dirty\'" interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time.

<12948702.1075846231556.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Steve,  The auction in Alberta involved the bidders bidding a lump sum price for the right to dispatch the formerly regulated generation plants and receive the revenue from the sale of energy and capacity.  The successful bidders assumed the obligation to pay the plant owner its fixed and variable costs of the plant for the term of the PPA. These generator fixed and variable costs were determined by an independent consultant retained by the Alberta Government and the auction was run by another independent consultant with auction expertise.   In contrast to the Alberta auction, I understand Jeff Skilling is envisioning an auction that would result in the selection of suppliers of 5 - 10 year power to California utilities.   The participants in the California auction would presumably be generators and traders who would offer to supply firm physical power - that would be used by the utilities as a physical hedge.  Presumably those with the lowest offers would win the 5-10 year supply con",2000-10-01,robert.hemstock@enron.com,Re: examples of auction processes that worked

PREPA is  forecasting a 75% dispatch thru that period.  If the dispatch is 75%, we  forecast that we would be running out of LNG about on the 8th.  Typically, we  nominate with a few days cushion against the late delivery date.  We decided  not to have a few days cushion for  the following reasons:  1. We avoid a cash flow shortfall of between $1-5 million (depending on the  ship size) prior to April 16, 2001.  2. Inventory projections are based on 100% power plant availability.  3. Based on lastest loading schedules, Cabot is expected to respond with  April4-6 delivery window.  4. There is sufficient LPG available to cover several days of LPG operation.  5. In the event that PREPA dispatches higher than 76% (and exposes themselves  to SFP), volumes that we have made available to PREPA are priced at  $6.75/mmBtu, which should cover our LPG cost",2001-03-13,rick.sierra@enron.com,Cash Flow

Moreover, we recognized that this project, due to the pricing formula defined with PDVSA, will likely pay a higher price for the gas than the domestic market will (and never lower)  and therefore is good business for Venezuela.  In the conversation with the Minister of Energy and Mines (he was even willing to call Chavez at that very same moment), the Minister acknowledged that no decision, either positive or negative, was already made.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

During the process, the committee has found three companies in contempt for resisting the subpoenas, including Enron, which fought back with a lawsuit asking the court to intervene on its behalf.  In his ruling stemming from the suit, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said he wasn‘t convinced that \'"the Senate committee will be able to maintain the petitioner‘s right to confidentiality.\'" As a result, he ruled, those documents handed over by Enron that contain legitimate trade secrets must be protected b",2001-09-07,bryan.gottfredson@enron.com,CA Energy Issues

The political risk of re-regulation has stepped up, in our view, reducing the multiple investors will pay for earnings *\tIn terms of earnings, ironically, the effect may be somewhat positive, albeit small (only 5% of market is affected).

The program then moves on to identify examples of the context  in which clients are using VaR in their business decisions.

I think the market  requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with  respect to transportation constraints.  The market has clearly seen a  divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects.  The  marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has  proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting  daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas  during these months.  Because of this, supply being transported from the  Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E.  This places  downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock  gas.

The vessel has been bareboat chartered to MTM Ship Management (\'"MTM\'") for  3 years from June 1999. MTM is a Singapore incorporated company. On the face,  our action should be against MTM.  2. Because MTM is not the beneficial owner of the vessel, Singapore law does  not allow ECTS to arrest it for a claim against MTM. Although arrest in  Malaysia is possible, it is procedurally very difficult (especially over the  weekend in Kuantan).  3. There is a strong possibility that MTM has substantial assets sufficient  to meet ECTS‘s claim. MTM manages about 8 - 10 vessels but are not likely to  own any.  4. I have discussed the matter with Alan and Richard. Our proposed plan of  action is as follows:  (a)  ECTS will not arrest the vessel in Malaysia over the weekend. If  necessary, the vessel can still be arrested on its next cycle or at the next  port which allows for arrest.

Because the outage was a force majeure event, this upper limit will be in place immediately. The outage is expected to last approximately six months.  Today‘s maximum system inventory limit is already 4,500 MMcf because total system demand is low.

Marois  Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International‘s insolvent California utility won‘t begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said.  The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn‘t explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said.  Southern California Edison, California‘s second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state‘s deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility‘s creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.‘s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state‘s largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April.

Enron Corp  is not defined in terms of individuals.  Thus, it seems there should not be a  legal issue.  Furhter, the Korean government, has been visited by no less  than 3 very senior Enron officials within the past year.  A change could make  officials more reluctant to talk with Enron because the company is constantly  changing people.  Otherwise, it is hard for me to see why an official would  want to cause trouble over a \'"domestic\'" (within Enron) matter.   My guess is the challenge would come from SK Corp, who might feel \'"we\'" are  trying to escape without living through the \'"honeymon\'" period and not \'"set  off\'" the Right-of-refusal.  There may be a desire to use various techniques,  including causing political trouble, to force either Newco management or  Oldco management to buy him out.

When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required,  so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA  approved document.

In determining the actual security required, we will need to review the megawatts in the contracts registered in detail once we have the acknowledgements tomorrow.

Some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the Pemex Fixed Price contract, and then re-purchasing the swaps. In some cases they are asking to get pre-paid, so we call treasury and calculate the NPV with the discoutn rate they give us ( Usually Enron‘s Cost of Funds). However, I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases, so that we offer a better alternative to the customer, than their own cost of funds.

While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment.  In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO.  PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA.  FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable.  While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that.

The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the  utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors.

It is changes to HQ‘s physical  deliveries (0 to 1500 MW) into NY that can swing the clearing price by at  least $20.  This is not just due to the price that HQ sells their energy for,  but is mostly due to the impact on congestion in NY of HQ deliveries.  When  HQ is not delivering high volumes, NY is generally uncongested and the price  for the entire state is set by gas generation in the East.  When HQ delivers  high volumes, the system becomes congested and the west price is set by much  lower cost resources and the east price is set by gas generation.  The impact  on the NY West price (Zone A) is at least $15 dollars.  Since the majority of  the OTC trades are settled against this price, it gives HQ tremendous ability  to trade financially and then influence the settlement price.

I expect Sunday to be weak to not run the unit on Sunday. I would expect to be back in the market on  Monday.   To sell the unit buy a BPA wheel using the accounts on the scheduling sheet. The variable price at the bottom is actual breakeven price.   To start the unit call PGE at the control room number and give them an hour to get the unit online before you sell. It takes 46 minutes to get the unit from cold start to full load and online.  Also, I‘ve bought reserves from BPA to make these schedules firm for the hour.

Specifically, the fallout from deregulation (take or pay contract defaults, etc.), the impact of the losses from the oil trading operation, the nationalization of the Peruvian pipeline, and the leveraging up to fend off the Carl Ichan takeover attempt.  2.
